# Lung_Disease Classification With EfficientNetB1 DeepLearning

This code implements a complete deep learning pipeline using EfficientNetB1 as the backbone for transfer learning, aimed at classifying chest X-ray images into three categories: Normal, Lung Opacity, and Viral Pneumonia. The dataset is first organized into separate folders for each class, and the file paths along with their corresponding labels are stored in a DataFrame. A pie chart is used to visualize the distribution of the classes, helping to identify any imbalances. The images are resized to 256x256 pixels during preprocessing, and sample images are displayed to check the quality of the data.

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling to ensure each class is proportionally represented. Data augmentation is applied via ImageDataGenerator, which rescales pixel values and enhances the image quality with a custom function that adjusts brightness, contrast, and sharpness to improve model performance on medical images. The model is built on EfficientNetB1, pre-trained on ImageNet, with additional Conv2D, GlobalAveragePooling2D, and Dense layers added to adapt it to the chest X-ray classification task. The final layer uses a softmax activation function to output probabilities for the three classes.

During training, the One-Cycle Learning Rate policy is employed through a custom callback, which adjusts the learning rate dynamically, improving convergence and generalization. The model is trained for 25 epochs using categorical crossentropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer. After training, the model is evaluated on the test set, where it achieved an impressive accuracy of 93.67%, demonstrating its ability to effectively classify chest X-ray images. Additional metrics such as the Cohen Kappa Score (0.9049) and detailed classification reports further confirm the model's strong performance, with high precision, recall, and F1-scores across all classes. This pipeline highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning and EfficientNetB1 in the medical image classification domain, achieving high accuracy and reliable performance.
